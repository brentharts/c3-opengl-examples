# C3 and OpenGL examples



### How to run


Install [C3](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c/releases/tag/latest) lang and `glfw` library

glfw on debian linux `sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev`

Then you can run examples with

`c3c run cube`

`c3c run texture`

`c3c run triangle`

`c3c run gltf`


OpenGL 4.3 is required to run all examples, MacOs unfortunately only supports 4.1.
Should work on Windows, but haven't tested the library bindings.

The OpenGL binding generator repository is [here](https://github.com/tonis2/opengl-c3)
